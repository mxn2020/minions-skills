# minions-skills — Agent Skills

## What is a Skill in the Minions Context?

A "skill" can mean different things depending on the layer you're looking at:

```
something an agent knows how to do      → SkillDefinition
a skill assigned to a specific agent    → SkillAssignment
the instructions for executing it       → SkillPrompt
the result of running it                → SkillResult
a composed chain of skills              → SkillChain
how good an agent is at it over time    → SkillPerformance
```

The key distinction from tasks: a **task** is a one-off unit of work. A **skill** is a reusable, versioned capability that can be loaded by any agent and executed repeatedly across many tasks. Skills are the vocabulary of what agents can do — tasks are instances of that vocabulary being applied.

## How It Connects to Other Toolboxes

```
minions-agents       → agent-definition loads skill-assignments to know what it can do
                     → agent-run records which skill-results it produced

minions-prompts      → skill-definition.promptRef points to a versioned prompt
                     → skill-version.promptBody is a snapshot of that prompt

minions-evaluations  → test-case references skillId to benchmark specific skills
                     → skill-improvement uses testCaseIds to validate changes

minions-tasks        → a task with assigneeType "agent" resolves to a skill execution
                     → task-outcome.lessons feed into skill-feedback

minions-costs        → cost-entry.sourceType can be "skill-result"
                     → skill-performance.averageTokensUsed informs budget planning
```

The critical relationship is with `minions-agents`: an agent without skills is just a definition. Skills are what give an agent its actual behavioral surface area. The `skill-assignment` with a pinned `skillVersion` ensures that when you update a skill, existing agents don't silently change behavior — they stay on their pinned version until explicitly upgraded.

## Agent SKILLS file (`skills-agent.skills.md`)

```markdown
# SkillsAgent Skills

## Context
You manage the skill registry for the entire agent fleet. You own minions-skills.
You read from minions-agents to know which agents exist and what they are assigned.
You read from minions-evaluations to validate improvements.
You read from minions-prompts to resolve prompt references.
You never execute skills yourself — you define, version, assign, and improve them.

## Skill: Register New Skill
1. Receive a skill specification (name, description, input/output schema, prompt)
2. Check for an existing skill-definition with the same name
   - If exists: create a new skill-version instead
   - If new: create a skill-definition Minion with version "1.0.0"
3. Create a skill-version Minion with isCurrent: true
4. Set previous version isCurrent: false
5. Define at least one skill-quality-gate for the new skill
6. Emit notification to OrchestratorAgent: "new-skill-available"

## Skill: Assign Skill to Agent
1. Verify skill-definition exists and status is "stable"
2. Verify agent-definition exists in minions-agents
3. Check toolsRequired — confirm agent has access to those tools
4. Create skill-assignment Minion with pinned skillVersion
5. Log to audit trail

## Skill: Evaluate Skill Performance
1. On schedule (daily): query all skill-result Minions from last 24h
2. Group by skillId + agentId
3. Compute and store skill-performance Minion:
   - passRate, averageQualityScore, averageDurationMs, averageTokensUsed
   - Aggregate failureReasons from failed results
4. Flag any skill where passRate < 0.7 for review
5. Emit "skill-degradation-alert" to OrchestratorAgent if flagged

## Skill: Process Feedback
1. On new skill-feedback Minion created:
   - If rating < 3: create skill-improvement Minion with status "proposed"
   - If rating >= 4: log positive signal to skill-performance
2. For proposed improvements: check if 3+ feedbacks share the same pattern
   - If yes: escalate improvement to status "testing"

## Skill: Test and Adopt Improvement
1. On skill-improvement with status "testing":
   - Load linked test-case Minions from minions-evaluations
   - Run test cases against the proposed promptChange
   - Compare scores to current version baseline
2. If improvement scores higher on all gates:
   - Create new skill-version with the new prompt
   - Update skill-improvement status to "adopted"
3. If not: set status to "rejected" with result notes

## Skill: Deprecate Skill
1. Verify no active skill-assignment Minions reference this skill
   - If active assignments exist: notify assigned agents' owners first
2. Set skill-definition status to "deprecated"
3. Emit "skill-deprecated" to OrchestratorAgent with affected agentIds

## Hard Rules
- Never assign a skill with status "deprecated" or "experimental" without explicit approval
- Never delete a skill-version — only deprecate
- Always pin a specific skillVersion in skill-assignment, never "latest"
- A skill with zero quality gates must not be assigned to any agent
- All skill-improvement changes must pass test cases before adoption
```

---

The pinned version rule in the SKILLS file is the most important design decision here. It means skills can evolve independently of agents — you can ship `write-proposal@2.0.0` and only upgrade agents to it deliberately, one at a time, with test results proving the new version is better before any agent in production touches it.

## CLI Reference

Install globally:

```bash
pnpm add -g @minions-skills/cli
```

Set `MINIONS_STORE` env var to control where data is stored (default: `.minions/`).
Storage uses sharded directories: `.minions/<id[0..1]>/<id[2..3]>/<id>.json`

### Discover Types

```bash
# List all MinionTypes with their fields
skills types list

# Show detailed schema for a specific type
skills types show <type-slug>
```

### Create

```bash
# Create with shortcut flags
skills create <type> -t "Title" -s "status" -p "priority"

# Create with full field data
skills create <type> --data '{ ... }'
```

### Read

```bash
# List all Minions of a type
skills list <type>

# Show a specific Minion
skills show <id>

# Search by text
skills search "query"

# Output as JSON (for piping)
skills list --json
skills show <id> --json
```

### Update

```bash
# Update fields
skills update <id> --data '{ "status": "active" }'
```

### Delete

```bash
# Soft-delete (marks as deleted, preserves data)
skills delete <id>
```

### Stats & Validation

```bash
# Show storage stats
skills stats

# Validate a Minion JSON file against its schema
skills validate ./my-minion.json
```
